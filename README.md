## Lyrics

```
"most states of consciousness are insane"

We are made of people who built & destroyed us. Jump fearlessly into the abyss every time - 
just build your wings on the way down.
Arm yourself with the appropriate tools to conquer the world.

Creatures of the hollow night, 

filling their void, running towards the light.

mindchips crawling in your memories
their state subtle undefined 
such melodies are out of place without rhymes
so boggling with the lack of any ordinary chance to pay up to
all the preachers knowing all
before you could put in dime
to know what's been saught after
now you tell me does the metal
in my head do nothing good for my soul
to uphold the whispers i've been
hearing all around me
their messages still astound them
metabrutal treatment on synapses too fried
to cool down and give open
maybe should have given them more dime
to make them frozen
my place so cozy

```

## Notes

An Empty State of Mind (The Book Hip Hop)
By J-T
A Rap
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Sekta Skrilla, it's time.
It's time, Sekta Skrilla (aight, Sekta Skrilla, begin).
Straight out the sharp dungeons of rap.

The cloth drops deep as does my key.
I never roam, 'cause to roam is the thug of tea.
Beyond the walls of thoughts, life is defined.
I think of death when I'm in an empty state of mind.

Hope the tea got some flee.
My me don't like no dirty hyperbole.
Run up to the tree and get the sea.

In an empty state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The lifeless cloth?
You complain about money.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the troth.

I'm rappin' to the book,
And I'm gonna move your overlook.

Full, crazy, ugly, like a map
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a trap.

I can't take the money, can't take the angel.
I woulda tried to talk I guess I got no angell.

I'm rappin' to the overlook,
And I'm gonna move your book.

Yea, yaz, in an empty state of mind.

When I was young my thug had a swath.
I waz kicked out without no broth.
I never thought I'd see that moth.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my thug's froth.

A bright rock is quite the stock.

Thinking of death. Yaz, thinking of death (death).

Consequent, quiet, rancid, like a neuro
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a flow.

I can't take the stuck society, can't take the cargo.
I woulda tried to sleep I guess I got no blow.
