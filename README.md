## Lyrics

```

"most states of consciousness are insane"

We are made of people who built & destroyed us. Jump fearlessly into the abyss every time - 
just build your wings on the way down.
Arm yourself with the appropriate tools to conquer the world.

Creatures of the hollow night, 

filling their void, running towards the light.

```
